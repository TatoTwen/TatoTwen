                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I learned there are many ways to structure the layout of a webpage.
                                You can incorporate animations to make the features more visually appealing 
                                and engaging. Furthermore, I noticed the layouts are made up of different boxes 
                                (flexboxes) put together.
                            </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I appreciate how the article incorporates a variety of page setups and animations.
                                I wouldn't have thought of some of the designs on my own. The lack of words also
                                allows me to focus on the designs themselves and what makes them so visually engaging.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>"Slider Ð¡oncept for the Architectural Bureau" and "Dark" were my favorites. The "Architectural Bureau" interface places the impressive buildings
                                at the forefront, as the viewer's attention is immediately drawn to them. It also has a sleek, luxurious feel. Meanwhile, the interface of "Dark"
                                is mysterious and spooky, fitting the theme of the game.

                            <p>7 - I liked having so many examples to draw from but would have appreciated more guidance on how to
                                replicate those designs.
