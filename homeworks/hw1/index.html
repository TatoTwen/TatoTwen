            <p>Hi, I'm Trinh! Some of the things I like include thrifting,
                anime, deep conversations, and creative writing. I'm always
                excited to meet new people and learn new things. :)</p>
            <p>My favorite places to eat:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Poke Parlor</li>
                <li>Kimchi Garden</li>

        <h2>Reading Response</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>From reading the article, I learned to pay attention to
                many small features of apps that I wouldn't have noticed
                otherwise. For instance, I never realized that the number
                of likes/retweets were bolded on Twitter.</li>
            <li>My favorite part of the article was the reminder to
                consider why some apps might be designed a certain way.
                I'd never thought about that before.</li>
            <li>A memorable quote for me was, "When I started off in design, 
                I sucked."</li>
            <li>I would score the article as an 8.</li>
